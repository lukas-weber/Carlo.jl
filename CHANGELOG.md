# Changelog

## 0.2.6 - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- Update to PrettyTables v3 and JSON v1 (#26) Thanks, @hz-xiaz!

## 0.2.5 - 2025-07-15

### Fixed

- Support for complex vector and higher rank observables (#25)

## 0.2.4 - 2025-04-25

### Added

- Added `run_time_from_slurm` to conveniently set the run time to match that of a surrounding slurm job.
- Some additional log messages that show the run time

### Changed

- Allow specifying days in run time and checkpoint time formats: `days-hours:months:seconds` (#24).

### Fixed

- When using `SingleScheduler` with MPI to execute a parallel-run mode job one run at a time, files are now written out correctly.
- Performance improvements when merging results
- Ensure writing out data after timeout (#23)

## 0.2.3 - 2024-11-22

### Changed

- ParallelTemperingMC: measurements are now buffered, leading to less communication overhead and allowing measurements during Carlo.sweep!

## 0.2.2 - 2024-10-23

### Added

- Added parallel tempering support through `ParallelTemperingMC` (#14).

### Changed

- changed AbstractMC interface signature `Carlo.register_evaluables(::Type{YourMC}, ::Evaluator, ::AbstractDict)` â†’ `Carlo.register_evaluables(::Type{YourMC}, ::AbstractEvaluator, params::AbstractDict)`. This is backwards compatible, but if you want to use parallel tempering, you have to use `::AbstractEvaluatior` or `::Any`.

### Fixed

- handling of Matrix or higher rank observables by ResultTools
- made `run -r` less likely to fail on distributed file systems
